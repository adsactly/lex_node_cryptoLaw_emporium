# AUTONOMOUS LAW DISCLOSURE - GABRIEL SHAPIRO/@lex_node

Last Fully Updated: 5/18/2021

***Please be advised:***

I am a lawyer admitted to practice in California. 

Unless we have entered into a written engagement letter providing for paid legal services, I am not your lawyer and do not represent you or your interests.

From time to time I engage in "autonomous lawyering," which means that in analyzing or discussing law or situations involving legal issues, I am representing myself or acting non-representationally in the context of belonging to a community of incentive-aligned supporters of a decentralized technology system. These communities and the persons in them are not my clients and I have no intention to treat their information as confidential or attorney-client privileged. I am acting on my own behalf, but will seek to provide accurate and honest information while observing my general nonrepresentational professional responsibilities such as demonstrating respect for the legal system. 

In engaging in autonomous lawyering, I am not acting on behalf of my law firm or any other employer of mine, nor on behalf of my clients (i.e., those with whom I have signed engagement letters providing that I will act as their attorney). If my views expressed in autonomous lawyering contexts are inaccurate, there will be no legal recourse against me and an injured party will not be covered by malpractice insurance.

For more about autonomous lawyering, please see [link](https://lexnode.substack.com/p/autonomous-lawyering). 

I currently engage in autonomous lawyering in the following communities and have the following economic interests therein: 
*  the yearn.finance / YFI community (own ~2 YFI and stake various tokens in yearn.finance vaults)

I also hold non-immaterial amounts (by portfolio %) of BTC, XMR, ETH, SUSHI, LDO, FLX, RAI & various stablecoins

I have rights to equity and/or tokens in various projects from my time as a member of MetaCartel Ventures DAO (includes FLX). 

I assume no duty and provide no guarantee of keeping these disclosures up to date, but currently anticipate updating them from time to time to reflect the changes I deem sufficiently material to warrant disclosure.
